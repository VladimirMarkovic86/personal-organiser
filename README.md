Guide
=====

* Clone project with command "git clone https://github.com/VladimirMarkovic86/personal-organiser.git" from terminal
* Download/Install Neo4J server from http://www.neo4j.org/
* Add cypher.default_language_version=3.1 at the end of .neo4j.conf file
* From project_root/resources extract data.zip file and reference data/graph.db folder with Neo4J application
* You can start Neo4j server now
* Download/Install MongoDB server from https://www.mongodb.com/
* From project_root/resources extract mongodb.zip file to <extracted_path>
* Modify <extracted_path>/mongodb/conf/mongod.conf file so it references mongodb folders structure
* From terminal execute next command mongod --config <extracted_path>/mongodb/conf/mongod.conf --smallfiles --fork
* Environment variable JAVA_CMD have to be set to $JAVA_HOME/bin/java;
  JAVA_HOME path should reference JDK
* From project root in terminal run command "lein run"
  or "lein repl" and in repl run command "(start-server)" to start application

Leiningen
=========

Version - 2.0

Leiningen is the easiest way to use Clojure. With a focus on project automation and declarative configuration, it gets out of your way and lets you focus on your code.

Clojure
=======

dependency - [org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Ring
====

dependency - [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.1.0"] [ring/ring-core "1.2.0"]

plugin - [lein-ring "0.8.5"]

Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple, unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web servers, and web frameworks.

Compojure
=========

dependency - [compojure "1.1.5"]

Compojure is a small routing library for Ring that allows web applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

ClojureScript
=========

plugin - [lein-cljsbuild "0.3.2"]

Command to build js files:

generates js development files that connects to brepl (browser repl) ->
lein cljsbuild once dev-grocery dev-meal dev-organism dev-login dev-planishrane

run brepl ->
lein trampolina cljsbuild repl-listen

generates js production file ->
lein cljsbuild once prod-grocery prod-meal prod-organism prod-login prod-planishrane

* Attention
When compiling javascript files, drools dependencies in project.clj file should be commented.
Afterwords uncomment drools dependencies and run project.

https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript

Tutorials from this address are followed for developing project.
https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs/blob/master/doc/tutorial-##.md
Except in 'tutorial-##' instead of '##' type numbers from 01 to 16. Sixteen tutorials cover ClojureScript and other tehnology. In future there may be more.

ClojureScript One
=================

The project includes a working sample application, useful tools, and libraries in various states of development. Many of the libraries in the project will eventually mature and become their own projects. The process of creating good libraries and frameworks takes time and experience. Instead of waiting until they are finished, we thought it would be better to show you now. Once you see the potential, we know that you will want to join in and help.

Great number of examples and ideas from this project were implemented in personal-organiser.
